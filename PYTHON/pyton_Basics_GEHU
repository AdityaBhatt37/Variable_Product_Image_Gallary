1.to check the version of a python setup : python --version (for wondows)
                                         : python3 --version (for ubuntu)

2.There are two way to run a python program/script:
  (i) by using interective mode 
      
      a)terminal(ubuntu), command prompt (windows) -> IDLE (windows)

      b)">>>" represent the interective mode.
       
      c) to start the interactive mode type "python" or "py" in cmd pythone3 in terminal.

      d) to close the interactive mode type : "exit()".


(ii) By using text mode
    
    a) In this we use text editors to write the python code 

    b) notepad, notepad++ (windows)
       IDE (pycharm, jupyter, spyder, VScode etc)
    
(iii) DIfference between these mode are:
    
     a) We can not store/ save program in interactive mode, 
        but in text mode we can store program and copy it from one location to another.
    
     b) We can write only one program in interactive mode but in text mode we can write
        mulitple prgrams and store them.

     c)Interactive mode is good to test small code or a any logic (testing a loop, if conditions, creating class and methods,
       creating user defined functions, etc...)

 3) To print any message in python : print ("type your message")
 
 4) In python variable is a type of container(memory location) in which we can store any type of value.
    there is no need to specify the data type for a variable. Python interpreter changes the data type
    for a variable. Python interpreter changes the data type of  a variable according to the value assigned to it.
 
 5)In python there is no need of declare a variable. We can direclty assign value to it.
   
   There are two ways to assign values to a variable:
   i)Assignment opereator i.e. "="
     -> VariableName = Value (constant value, another variable's value, calculation)

  ii)Using Input() function.
     -> Used in two ways:
        a)->simple "input()" function/method. :-> VarialbeName = input()
        b)->VariableName = input("Enter a number : ")
          
          ->print("type your message", VariableName, "Type your message"......)
